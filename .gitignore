# Python
# A comprehensive .gitignore for Python projects

# Byte-compiled files
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*$py.class

# IDE and editor files
.vscode/
.idea/
*.sublime-project
*.sublime-workspace
.DS_Store

# Virtual environment
.venv/
venv/
env/
/bin
/lib
/include
# Virtual environments can be named anything, so it's good to exclude common ones.
# To be safe, add the name of your virtual environment folder here, if it's not one of these.

# Operating system files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Dependencies
# It's a good practice to not commit your dependencies, as they can be installed using a requirements file.
# The `requirements.txt` file should be committed, but the packages themselves should not.
# You can use pip freeze > requirements.txt to create this file.
*.egg-info/
dist/
build/

# Log and database files
*.log
*.sqlite3
db.sqlite3

# API keys and sensitive information
# This is the most critical part for your project.
# Never commit files that contain API keys, passwords, or other sensitive data.
# A common practice is to use a separate file for these keys and add it to your .gitignore.
# Example:
secrets.py
config.py
.env
