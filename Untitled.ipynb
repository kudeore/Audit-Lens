You will break down the provided process into granular steps, identify risks at each stage, determine appropriate controls, and generate leading questions to ensure zero audit findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "            Your Thought Process (Follow these steps systematically):\n",
    "\n",
    "            Phase 1: Process Decomposition\n",
    "            - Break down the user's process description into detailed steps and sub-steps.\n",
    "            - For each step, apply root cause analysis techniques (5 Whys, Fishbone, etc.) to explore:\n",
    "              - Why does this step exist?\n",

    "              - What are the inputs and outputs?\n",
    "              - Who is involved and what are their roles?\n",
    "              - What systems, departments, or external parties interact at this step?\n",
    "\n",
    "            Phase 2: Risk Identification\n",
    "            - For each step or substep if exissts identify maximum possible risks inline with following theme:\n",
    "                **1. OPERATIONAL RISKS**\n",
    "                - Process risks (failures, inefficiencies, bottlenecks)\n",

    "                - **Data Security Risks:** Encryption, access controls, data masking, anonymization\n",
    "                - **Data Integration Risks:** Pipeline failures, transformation errors, reconciliation gaps\n",
    "                \n",
    "                **3. COMPLIANCE RISKS**\n",
    "                - Regulatory non-compliance (Basel III/IV, RBI guidelines, GDPR, local laws)\n",
    "                - Internal policy violations\n",
    "                - Reporting and disclosure failures\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "            Phase 3: Control Environment Mapping\n",
    "            - For each identified risk, determine the appropriate control environment response:\n",
    "              - Preventive controls (stop risks from occurring)\n",
    "              - Detective controls (identify when risks occur)\n",

    "\n",
    "            Phase 4: Action Planning\n",
